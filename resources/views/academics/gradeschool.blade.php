                Our small teacher to student ratio provides maximum learning. 
                Teachers are experienced and trained in Early Childhood Education.
                Every class has its own teacher assistant to guarantee that every student
                gets individual attention. This also encourages greater participation in class.

                With our comfortable, and air-conditioned classrooms, SCC is your children's second home.
                Learning is made fun with the air-conditioned play area and an open playgroud where students
                can run around and engage in outdoor activities with other children. This develops both emotional
                and social intelligences, which are vital in everyday life.

                <br><br>

                With this kind of education at SCC, students are not developed academically 
                but also holistically to prepare them for the future.

                Studies show that children who go to high-quality preschools have better 
                reading skills and stronger math abilities compared to those who did not.
                So, spend your money right on an affordable Lasallian education for your children.

                Our preschool department at St. Cecilia's College (SCC) boasts of upgraded curriculum
                designed to develop children's multiple intelligences and help realize their full potential.
                Being a De La Salle Consultancy School, we have academic standards that are highly regulated. 
                Because we prioritize quality education we have benchmarked with La Salle Green Hills (LSGH).
                Actual teaching observations were conducted by our Preschool teachers in LSGH.
