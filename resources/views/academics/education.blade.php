           <p>With the upcoming implementation of the K to 12 curriculum in both 
              private and public schools, the demand for teachers will be more than the supply,
              thus there will be shortage of teachers and employment will then be easy. 
              Furthermore, foreign demand of Filipino teachers especially for English is very high.
